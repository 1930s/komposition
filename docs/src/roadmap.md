# Roadmap

Komposition 0.1.0 has just been released. Although it's very exciting,
Komposition is lacking some big features. For coming releases, we're
hoping to include the following features, amongst others:

* Commands
    - Insert video/clip at any focus
    - Insert composition (sequence, parallel)
    - Join composition (sequence, parallel)
    - Re-trim clip (change start and end timestamps)
* Image (still frame) import
* Save/open project
* Script/subtitle import and split
* Subtitle editing
* Command fuzzy completion
* Undo
* Yank/paste
* Preview
    - Preview individual clip (video and audio)
    - Preview in library
    - Preview image for video gaps
    - Preview image for audio clips
    - Preview image for audio gaps
* More Vim-like bindings

If you have any other suggestions, or want to help with these features,
please head over to the [Gitter
room](https://gitter.im/owickstrom/komposition) to discuss them.
