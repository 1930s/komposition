# Navigation

To navigate the timeline in a Komposition project, you modify the *focus*.
The focus describes the current part of the timeline you're focusing. It is
modified using movement commands, such as the "Focus Left" and "Focus Up"
commands.

Visually, it's represented with a white border around the focused
timeline part. For example:

* Focusing a sequence:

* Focusing a parallel:

* Focusing a video clip:
