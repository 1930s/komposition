# Projects

In Komposition, the top-level concept is the _project_. The following are all
part of a project:

* the timeline
* the current focus
* the library with its media assets
* video rendering settings
* proxy media settings
* directory path to store intermediate files in

All these things belong to the project. Very important to note, however, is
that in the current version of Komposition projects are _implicit_. When
you start the application a new project is implicitly created for you. There
is no way to save and reopen projects, so when you exit the application your
implicit project will be lost.

!!! note
    Support for explicitly creating, saving, and reopening projects is planned for future versions of Komposition.
